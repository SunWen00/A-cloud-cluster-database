# A-cloud-cluster-database
This repository is the dataset for the paper “Digital Imaging Simulation and Closed-Loop Verification Model of Infrared Payloads in Space-Based Cloud–Sea Scenarios”.

A-cloud-cluster-database is a space-based cloud cluster database built on real on-orbit infrared images. It aims to provide high-credibility cloud background data support for digital imaging simulation of infrared payloads, target detection algorithm training, and system performance verification in space-based cloud-sea scenarios. This database addresses the issues of scarce infrared characteristic data and poor physical consistency in traditional complex cloud-sea scenario simulations, and it serves as a core data component of the DISV (Digital Imaging Simulation and Verification) model proposed in the paper Digital Imaging Simulation and Closed-Loop Verification Model of Infrared Payloads in Space-based Cloud–Sea Scenarios.

Through morphological operations on on-orbit satellite images, the database extracts cloud cluster morphological features and constructs a standardized dataset. It supports the flexible generation of cloud mask images with different Cloud Coverage (CC) rates, and can be directly used for space-based infrared cloud-sea composite background reconstruction, infrared radiation characteristic calculation, and robustness testing of target detection algorithms.
